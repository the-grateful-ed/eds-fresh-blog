# Ethernaut CTF
## Fallback (Level 1 Walkthru)
### Introduction

Ethernauts is a capture the flag (CTF) game created by OpenZeppelin that allows
players to learn about smart contract security by hacking vulnerable contracts.
In this blog post, we will walk through the first level of the game, which is
called "Fallback".

The goal of this level is to steal all the ether from the contract's fallback
function, which is a function that is called when someone sends ether to a
contract without specifying a specific function to call.

### Analysis

<CH.Section>
- Upon first inspection, we can see that the owner is [defined as msg.sender in the constructor.](focus://7,16)
- There is a [mapping relating addresses to a uint](focus://6), the uint being a contribution amount.
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Fallback {

  mapping(address => uint) public contributions;
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    contributions[msg.sender] = 1000 * (1 ether);
  }

  modifier onlyOwner {
        require(
            msg.sender == owner,
            "caller is not the owner"
        );
        _;
    }

  function contribute() public payable {
    require(msg.value < 0.001 ether);
    contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    if(contributions[msg.sender] > contributions[owner]) {
      owner = msg.sender;
    }
  }

  function getContribution() public view returns (uint) {
    return contributions[msg.sender];
  }

  function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  receive() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}
```
